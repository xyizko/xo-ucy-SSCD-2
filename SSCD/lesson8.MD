# lesson8 - Notes 

1. These are notes for this specific file
2. Deployment is being done within the IDE itself which has test nets 
    - The other way is to use anvil and deploy to that
3. `view` Are used for reading the state of the function and no changes. Since there are no changes there is no gas cost , but there is still tx execution cost 
4. `pure` - Pure functions disallow updating stage and disallows reading from storage also
5. Note when you deploy a contract using remix, evey function canbe seen as its own button. Which allows execution of the function, note that all executions costs gas
