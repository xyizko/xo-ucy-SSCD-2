# lesson8 - Notes 

1. These are notes for this specific file
2. Deployment is being done within the IDE itself which has test nets 
    - The other way is to use anvil and deploy to that
3. `view` Are used for reading the state of the function and no changes. Since there are no changes there is no gas cost , but there is still tx execution cost 
4. `pure` - Pure functions disallow updating stage and disallows reading from storage also
5. Note when you deploy a contract using remix, evey function canbe seen as its own button. Which allows execution of the function, note that all executions costs gas 
6. Note the changes in gas costs, dependent on the function and dize of the variable that is going to be stored 
7. `returns` - Similar to other programming langs, will return the variable from the function
